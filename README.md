<h2>Abstract</h2>
The need for efficient and optimized bus schedules is a common problem in public transportation systems. Efficient bus schedules not only benefit passengers by reducing wait times and increasing reliability, but they also benefit bus operators by reducing costs and improving efficiency. The Bus Schedule Optimization project is a software engineering project aimed at optimizing bus schedules using a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm takes into account the bus routes, stops, and schedules to find the optimal schedule that minimizes waiting time for passengers and maximizes efficiency for the bus operator. The project is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing users to input their own data and parameters to generate a customized optimal schedule. Overall, this project has the potential to improve public transportation systems by reducing wait times and increasing efficiency.
